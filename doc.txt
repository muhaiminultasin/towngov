 Stripe Integration: Switching from Test Mode to Live Mode
Client Guide: Switching to Live Stripe Keys
When you're ready to start accepting real payments, you'll need to switch from Test Mode (used for development and testing) to Live Mode (used for actual transactions). Follow these simple steps to update your integration.

1. Obtain Your Live Secret and Publishable Keys
You can find your Live Keys in your Stripe Dashboard.

Steps to get your live keys:
Log in to your Stripe Dashboard.

Navigate to Developers > API keys.

Youâ€™ll see two sets of keys:

Publishable Key (Starts with pk_live_)

Secret Key (Starts with sk_live_)

Copy both the Live Secret Key and Live Publishable Key.

2. Update the .env File for Backend
Your backend code is configured with test keys. To switch to live mode, you'll need to update the backend with the live secret key.

How to do this:
Go to the .env file in the backend project.

Replace the test secret key (sk_test_...) with the live secret key (sk_live_...).

Example .env for live mode:

env
Copy
Edit
# Live Secret Key
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
3. Update the .env File for Frontend
Similarly, you need to update the frontend to use the live publishable key.

How to do this:
Go to the .env file in the frontend project.

Replace the test publishable key (pk_test_...) with the live publishable key (pk_live_...).

Example .env for live mode:

env
Copy
Edit
# Live Publishable Key
REACT_APP_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
4. Restart the Backend Server
After updating the .env file:

Stop the backend server (press Ctrl + C).

Restart the server by running the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
node server.js
5. Test the Live Setup
Go to the website and try making a real donation (using a real credit card).

After switching to live keys, any donation attempt will involve real money.

Important Notes for Clients:
Never share your secret keys with anyone. Keep them safe and secure.

If you ever need to switch back to test mode to perform development, simply replace the live keys with the test keys and restart the server.

Ensure you are using live keys only once you're ready to start accepting real payments to avoid unwanted charges.

Do not commit the .env file to version control (e.g., Git). Always keep it in .gitignore to prevent exposing your keys.

Steps Recap:
Obtain Live Keys from the Stripe Dashboard.

Update the .env files in both the frontend and backend with the live keys.

Restart your backend server to apply changes.
